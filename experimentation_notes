We found the following data for what should be finding exact and
precise gaussian distributions with mu=0, sigma=1

Something is wrong in the Bessel correction... not sure what.
It's *probably* becuase Poisson is not 100% correct due to low
statistics in a given bin, and a Binomial would be correct.

At any rate, I found that a modified Bessel correcetion of
[N/(N-1)]^2 (as opposed to standard with no square) does fairly
accurately calculate statistical uncertainty for JIGGLES >= 4.

This is... a kind of statistics abuse, but it works on the data I
tested.

Hoever even that does not work below JIGGLES < 4
There does seem to be a very slight (<2%) bias, and it does
approach 0 as jiggles approaches infinity.
20 is probably good enough, although even 4 is probably good enough.
Checking using Toy Data with known distribution. Below should be
exactly 1. If it's not, then statistical prediction is off by that amount.

Ran many simulations with Binomial distribution instead of Poisson.
However, data was equally skewed and not as would be predicted by a Binomial distribution.
I tink it is because in the jiggling state, repeated reviews give different results due to random nature of the toy data.
Best to switch over to real data and see how that works.
